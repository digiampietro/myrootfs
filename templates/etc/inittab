# Busybox init does not support runlevels, this field is ignored:
#   <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>
#
# The <id> field is used to specify the controlling TTY for the process.
#       This is different then sysvinit behavior!
#
# System startup
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
#::sysinit:/etc/init.d/udev start

# Console
# It seems madness not to 'respawn' the console login, but not doing so gets rid of a whole load of error messages in
# the kernel log when we are configured for no console via the absence of switch 3. The implication of not respawning
# is that if you log out of the main console (RS232 serial communication over ttyS2) you will not be able to log
# back in without rebooting the machine. If someone finds a better method of sorting this out we could change 'once'
# back to 'respawn'
ttyS0::respawn:/sbin/getty -L 115200 ttyS0

# Go into runlevel 0 (Halt)
#::shutdown:/etc/init.d/rcH
